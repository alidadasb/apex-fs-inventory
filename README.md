**To run the client:**

`cd client`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Client: http://localhost:4200/ 


**To run the server**

`cd server`

`gradlew bootRun`

Server: http://localhost:8080/

**Requirements**

Enhance the client/server code to implement the following features: 

* Implement Server side search by product name (any product contains the name)
* Implement add product to inventory (uniqueness on product name)
* Implement remove from inventory
* Implement edit inventory items (name,price,quantity)

**Notes:**
- Use bootstrap to decorate the UI (included)
- Feel free to change the existing code as needed
- Clean & Modular code is important
